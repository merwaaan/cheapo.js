Currently, most games seem to work without issues. Some parts that still need a bit of work:
* There is a lot of screen flickering because of the constant CLS calls (some kind of software double buffering could help?)
* Binary XmlHttpRequests used to get ROMs retrieve wrong data on Chrome (but this works well locally, or with Firefox)
