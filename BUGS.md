# General

* ROMs are corrupted when retrieved via XmlHttpRequest on Chrome (works locally or with Firefox)
* Not a bug, but fullscreen would be nice

# Game-specific

* Lunar Lander: Explosion looks weird when losing
* Field!: Looks weird
* Animal Race: animals create pixel trails (bug in XOR mode?)
